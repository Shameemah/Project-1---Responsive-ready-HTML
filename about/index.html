        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
        I was born and raised in Ghana, a beautiful country in West Africa, with one older
        sister, my mother and father. After completing my high school education at SOS 
        Hermann Gmeiner International College in 2014, I moved to the USA for college. I 
        initially started out as an Architecture and switched to Information Technology 
        and Management after a year. In my opinion, this was one of the best decisions I've 
        ever made. I am currently pursuing both my bachelors and masters in ITM with a 
        specialization in Software Development and Data management respectively. I
        work as a freelance Graphic Designer in my free time.

        <p>After college, I hope to own my very own Graphics Design firm. I also hope to start
        a company that focuses on teaching young women in Ghana how to code. In terms of ITM,
        I am willing to go wherever the wind takes me.</p>
